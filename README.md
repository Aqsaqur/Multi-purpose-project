🧩 What is a Multi-Purpose Project in Python?

A multi-purpose project is a Python program that performs multiple useful tasks within a single system or platform — rather than just doing one thing.

It’s like having many small tools or apps inside a single program.
For example, imagine a software that can:

Calculate numbers 🧮

Translate text 🌍

Manage notes 📝

Convert currencies 💵

Send emails 📩

All of these are different functions, but they reside within one project.
That’s why it’s called multi-purpose.
